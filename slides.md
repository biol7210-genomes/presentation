## Illumina Sequencing

---

## Sequencing method

- "Sequence by synthesis"
	-  Sample DNA is sheered and ligated to primers
	- Bridge amplification 
	- Sequencing reaction
- Each insert has a unique tag, barcode
	- Barcode is unique for each DNA sample in run
	- Barcode read step of synthesis reaction

## Illumina other

Stuff

##  Genome Pipeline
  - Quality Control and pre-processing
  - Read assembly: *de novo* and reference guided assembly 
	- Types of *de novo* assemblers
	- Assembly programs chosen for testing
  - Assembly improvement
	- Polishing
	- Gap filling
	- Contig integration
	- Automated SNP calling for reference guided assemblies
  - Assembly quality assessment 


---


## Quality Control and pre-processing

- Remove barcodes
- Remove poor quality reads
- Filter duplicates (Typically for speed considerations)

---

## QC software

stuff

## Read assembly: *de novo* and reference guided assembly

- *De novo*: from new
	- SPAdes, Velvet, whatever else
	- Use only sequence information to order reads 
	- Limitations
	- Pros
	- cons
- Reference Guides
	- bwa/bowtie, SMALT PILON
	- "fast"
	- SNP detection
	- Lots of "left over" reads
